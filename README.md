# Easy Resume Website Template!
## INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be sure to have your own free GitHub account before starting
- If you don't have a LinkedIn account, **STOP** here and make one!
- Keep the instructions open in this tab, and [open the repo in another tab](https://github.com/sladeberryman/resume-template)
- At the top of the screen click the "Fork" button
   * Only change the repo name if you must
- Click the green "Create fork" button
- You should now be in your new repository
- Click on the README.md file
   * You can click the three dots in the top right to delete this file, or change it to say what you want by clicking the pen button.
   * click the green "Commit changes" button
- Create a new branch
   * Click on the branch dropdown that should say "main"
   * Click "View all branches"
   * Click "New Branch"
   * Name it whatever you want
   * Make sure the new branch's source is **YOUR** repository and main branch
   * Click "Create new branch"
- You should complete the following steps in your new branch
- Click on resume.json
   * I know this may look complicated, but we will get the hang of it quickly
   * Let's come back to this shortly
- Click on the example.json file.
   * Do not edit this file so that it will always be here for reference if you mess up resume.json
   * This is the basis of the formatting used in resume.json
- The file consists of sections like name: followed with its contents
- The only sections that could contain multiple blocks of information are "education" and "experience".
   * This is in case you have multiple degrees or multiple past jobs
- If you have had multiple degrees or jobs, you must copy the sections from **brace to brace**, not brackets
- Pay attention to how I used commas. Each element in a data object has a comma after it **except the last**
   * This includes the main sections and the data points inside of them
- In resume.json, click the edit button (the pen) and replace my data with yours
   * if you are having issues with formatting at any point, take a couple minutes to [read this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
- Click the "Commit changes" button (to the main branch)
- Navigate to the main repository folder, then click the settings button at the top of the page
- Click "Pages" on the left side
- Under "Branch", change "None" in the dropdown to the name of your new branch (not main) then "Save"
- Navigate back to the main repo folder
- Click the gear button beside the "About" section
- Under "Website" make sure "Use your GitHub Pages website" is checked
   * click "Save changes"
- Wait a few minutes and then click your website link under thr "About" description!
- Check to see if your resume website is working and looks clean
   * If it is not rendering your data or it looks off, the resume.json is probably formatted wrong
   * Fix errors with commas or other issues in resume.json and commit the changes again
   * Wait a few minutes for the changes to load into your site and check it again
- When you are happy with your resume website, feel free to share the link as you please!
